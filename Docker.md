- Docker is an open-source platform that 
    - automates the deployment, 
    - scaling
    - management of applications using containerization. 
- Containers are <span style="color:yellow"> lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient </span> units that package an application

- **<span style="color:red"> Container</span>**: A standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.


- **<span style="color:red"> Image </span>**: A lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.


- **<span style="color:red"> Dockerfile**: A text file that contains a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image.


- **<span style="color:red"> Docker Hub**: A cloud-based registry service that allows you to store and share Docker images.


- **<span style="color:red"> Volume**: A mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.


- **<span style="color:red"> Network**: A way to connect Docker containers to each other and to the outside world.
